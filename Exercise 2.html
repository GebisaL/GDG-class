    <h1> WELCOME TO TRAVELLER.COM</h1>

        In a small, cobblestone town nestled between misty hills, there lived a clockmaker named Elias. His workshop was tucked into a narrow alley, its windows glowing warmly even during the coldest nights. Within, countless clocks ticked in perfect harmony, yet none were ordinary—they seemed almost alive, their hands gliding smoothly as if guided by invisible thoughts.
Elias had inherited a secret from his grandfather: a tiny, intricate key that could unlock the “Time Chamber,” a hidden compartment in the heart of the largest clock in the town square. Legend said the chamber contained a single golden hourglass capable of bending time itself. But with that power came a caveat: whoever altered time risked losing an irreplaceable part of themselves—memories, emotions, or even love.
For years, Elias resisted temptation. He repaired clocks for townspeople, listened to the melodic ticks, and watched life pass by unaltered. But one bitter winter, a mysterious child appeared at his door, shivering and clutching a faded photograph of a family long gone. She spoke only one sentence: “I want yesterday back.”
Elias remembered his grandfather’s warnings. To reverse time was dangerous, yet the child’s plea stirred the deepest part of his heart. With trembling hands, he wound the largest clock, inserted the golden key, and opened the Time Chamber. The golden hourglass shimmered, suspended in mid-air, sand flowing backward like liquid sunlight.
As the last grain returned to the top, the child smiled, and the town lay quiet, untouched. Yet Elias felt a pang in his mind. The memory of his childhood dog, playful and mischievous, had vanished, leaving only a hollow ache. The child had her family restored, but the cost had been silently assigned to him.
Elias understood the truth: the hourglass did not take time—it traded it. And though sorrow had claimed a piece of him, he discovered that real magic was not in reversing moments, but in the courage to face the present and hold it gently, even when it trembled beneath the weight of what could be lost.
From then on, the clocks in his workshop ticked with a richer resonance, each second a reminder that time, once shared with another, could teach lessons more profound than even the golden hourglass could offer. And sometimes, just sometimes, the mysterious child could be seen standing in the town square, waving—unaware of the invisible debt her joy had fulfilled.
